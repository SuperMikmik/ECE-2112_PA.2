<h3>NORMALIZATION PROBLEM:</h3>
<h4>In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy</h4>
This problem is straightforward as the parameters of the problem, the equation, and the function needed are all indicated in the instructions. With this knowledge, we just need to create a 5 x 5 random array with the .random function. Complete the normalization equation with the random array, save the values, and then the problem is solved.<br><br>

<h3>DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM:</h3>
<h4>Create a 10 x 10 ndarray containing the squares of the first 100 positive integers. From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy</h4>
The tricky part about this problem is creating the 10 x 10 array containing the first 100 squared integers. I took some time and a bit of help to get the desired output (when you realize you can just use the reshape function).  After that, the divisible by three is straightforward, as we can use the module's operation to get the desired output. After that, save the values, then the job is complete.<br><br>
